2. Windsurf

Developer / Company: Codeium

Primary Features:
Windsurf is an agent-based IDE that focuses on higher-level reasoning instead of line-by-line code suggestions. It can plan changes, apply them across a project, and maintain context over longer development sessions. This makes it feel more like an autonomous coding partner.

Pricing Model:
Free version available; paid plans for advanced features.

Supported Languages:
JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, Go, and C#.

3. Replit Agent

Developer / Company: Replit

Primary Features:
Replit Agent works as an AI pair programmer inside Replit’s online IDE. It can create full projects, install dependencies, run applications, debug errors, and deploy code. Its main advantage is that everything runs in the browser, making setup extremely fast.

Pricing Model:
Limited free usage; subscription required for extended agent features.

Supported Languages:
Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, HTML/CSS, and many others.

4. v0.dev

Developer / Company: Vercel

Primary Features:
v0.dev is an AI tool focused on frontend and UI generation. Developers describe the interface they want using natural language, and the tool generates React components using modern frameworks like Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is mainly used for fast UI prototyping.

Pricing Model:
Free tier with limits; paid plans for higher usage.

Supported Languages:
JavaScript and TypeScript (React ecosystem).

5. Bolt.new

Developer / Company: StackBlitz

Bolt.new is a browser-based AI full-stack development tool. It can generate frontend and backend code, manage dependencies, and run applications without requiring local setup. This makes it ideal for quick experimentation and learning purposes.

Pricing Model:
Free tier available; paid plans for more intensive usage.

Supported Languages:
JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js-based frameworks.

6. GitHub Copilot Workspace

Developer / Company: GitHub (Microsoft)

Primary Features:
GitHub Copilot Workspace expands on the original Copilot by allowing developers to work from tasks or GitHub issues. It can analyze a repository, suggest implementation plans, and generate pull requests, supporting a more structured development workflow.

Pricing Model:
Subscription-based (part of GitHub Copilot plans).

Supported Languages:
Most major programming languages supported by GitHub Copilot.

7. Lovable

Developer / Company: Lovable

Primary Features:
Lovable is an AI-powered tool aimed at quickly generating full applications from natural language descriptions. It focuses on speed and accessibility, making it suitable for non-expert developers or early-stage prototypes.

Pricing Model:
Free tier with limitations; paid plans for advanced usage.

Supported Languages:
Primarily JavaScript-based web technologies.

Part 2:

When I first started using AI tools for coding, I mostly saw them as faster autocomplete systems. They were helpful, but limited. After researching and experimenting with vibe coding tools, I realized that these tools work in a very different way. Instead of only helping with writing code faster, they try to understand what the developer actually wants to build and how the whole project fits together.

With traditional code completion tools, everything is very local. You write a line, the tool suggests the next one, and that’s it. It helps with syntax and speed, but it does not really understand what you are trying to build. Vibe coding tools feel different because they allow you to talk to the codebase in a way. Instead of thinking line by line, you can think in terms of features or problems. For example, instead of fixing an error manually in several files, you can describe the issue and let the tool help you apply changes more broadly.

GitHub Copilot feels like a middle step between classic autocomplete and vibe coding. It is clearly more powerful than traditional completion, but the interaction is still mostly passive. You wait for suggestions and then decide whether to accept them. With vibe coding tools, the interaction feels more active. You ask questions, give instructions, and sometimes argue with the AI until it gives you something usable. This makes the development process feel more like collaboration than assistance, especially when you are exploring new ideas or learning something unfamiliar.

Using tools like ChatGPT or Claude in a separate window is something I was already doing before this assignment. It is useful, but also a bit annoying because of constant copy-pasting and context switching. You explain the problem again and again, and sometimes the answer does not fully match your actual code. IDE-integrated vibe coding tools solve this by already knowing the project. Because the AI can see the files and structure, the suggestions feel more relevant and easier to apply. This makes the workflow smoother and less fragmented.

Of course, vibe coding tools are not perfect. Sometimes they try to do too much or make changes that do not fully match what you had in mind. When that happens, you still need to understand the code and fix things manually. This reminded me that these tools do not replace thinking, they just change how thinking is supported. For small tasks, traditional code completion or Copilot can actually feel more reliable and controlled.

Overall, working with vibe coding tools made me think less about writing code line by line and more about describing what I want to achieve. That was the most surprising part for me. I do not think these tools replace developers, but they definitely change how developers interact with code.
Because of this, I think each type of tool fits a different situation. Traditional code completion works best when the task is small and well-defined and you already know what you want to write. GitHub Copilot is useful when you want faster development without losing too much control. Vibe coding tools are especially helpful when working on larger features, refactoring, or when you are still figuring out the problem itself. Using the right tool at the right time feels more effective than relying on a single AI solution for everything.
