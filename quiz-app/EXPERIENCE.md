# Experience Report – Vibe Coding Project

## Tool Selection Justification

I chose Cursor for this project because it is directly integrated into the code editor and makes working with AI feel more natural. Instead of switching between different tools, I could interact with the AI while seeing and editing my actual project files. This made it a good choice for experiencing what vibe coding is like.

## Development Process

The project started with a basic quiz structure. My main focus was improving and extending it rather than building everything from scratch. Using Cursor, I made the interface more colorful, ensured the quiz was responsive on different devices, shuffled questions and answers on restart, fixed small logic issues, and added a simple leaderboard using localStorage.

## Challenges and Solutions

During development, I encountered small logic and flow issues, such as UI elements not behaving correctly at the end of the quiz. I used Cursor to help identify and fix these problems, but I still needed to review and adjust the code manually. This showed that AI tools are helpful, but they do not remove the need to understand the code.

## Reflection

This project showed me that vibe coding is less about writing code line by line and more about describing goals and problems clearly. Cursor made development faster and more interactive, but the best results came when I treated the AI as a support tool rather than relying on it completely. I would use similar tools again for future projects, especially for small applications and experimentation.
